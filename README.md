# LinearEquations
A program for solving linear equations.
You type in the number of different equations, and then the number of different variables in your equation (2x+3y=5 is 2 different variables because x and y is variables).
Then you proceed to type in each equation. Don't use spaces, and if there is only 1 of a variable you still have to type 1 in front of it (1y=5).
Then the program will calculate the linear equations using Gaussion elimination (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination).
